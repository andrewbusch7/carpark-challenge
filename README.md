# Carpark

This is a simple Azure Functions project to calculate the cost of a carpark session where there are various cost rules at
play.

It demonstrates several effective coding practices:

- Rich Domain Models (decoupling domain behaviour from application integration)
- Testing behaviour not implementation
- Picking the right design pattern for a task (e.g. Gang of Four's Strategy Pattern)

Throughout the code, there are comments where alternate approaches or extension directions are worth highlighting,
particularly if the application were to scale and take real usage.
